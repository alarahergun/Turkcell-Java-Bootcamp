# Turkcell-Java-Bootcamp

  I am a beginner in both Java and OOP. This is my first project, which is about the controlling system of a coffee shop management for two brands : Starbucks and Nero. In this project; Customer Management, Campaign Services and Campaign Integration for the sales are available for the customers. A three-layered structure (Data Access, Business, Presentation) is tried to be held.
